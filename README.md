# FlappyBird
A console game Flappy Bird built in C++.

### Description & Game Rules
Users are to control the bird and pass through the randomly generated obstacles.  
Users can control the movement of the bird by pressing space bar so that the bird would receive an upward momentum that pushes it higher.  
However, certain restriants are placed so that the game isn't that easy!  
The bird must not touch the top and bottom side of the console.  
In addition, users can not keep pushing the bird as the bird must be falling a bit before raising up again.  
Once the bird touches the top or bottom margins or the obstacles, the game will end.  
Users can press space bar to start a new game.  
The number of games, the current score, and the highest score will be recorded.
